      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify">&quot;Kneeling day&quot; is the term given to a feria or vigil on which the following occur:</p>
        <p>1. Lauds 2 (first psalm is Miserére)<br>
        2. Fourth psalm is said at Prime<br>
        3. Ferial preces are said at Lauds, Prime and the Little Hours.</p>
        <p align="justify">These are of course the penitential days of the 
        liturgical year. These include the ferias of Advent and Lent, most 
        vigils, and Ember Days on which no feast occurs. They are named 
        &quot;kneeling days&quot; because at these times of penance, much of the Office is 
        said kneeling instead of standing, for example, the Preces at all the 
        Hours, the Collect, and so on. Even at High Mass, the congregation is 
        supposed to remain kneeling for parts of the Mass at which they would 
        normally stand, eg. The Collect, the Pater Noster, the Postcommunion. 
        The liturgical colour on a kneeling day should normally be purple.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify">The Chair of Unity Octave is one of the most special 
        and richly indulgenced novenas of the Church year.&nbsp; Its origin 
        makes one of the most fascinating stories in American Church history, 
        for it centers around the extraordinary vocation of the apostle of 
        Unity, Father Paul James Francis of the Atonement.</p>
        <p align="justify">Numerous Anglican groups who were received 
        corporately into the Church attribute their conversion to the Chair of 
        Unity Octave, which is truly a rainbow of hope for the conversion of 
        those nations and peoples still wandering in the mists of error and 
        schism.&nbsp; This is the goal of the only true ecumenical movement.</p>
        <p align="justify">The Chair of Unity Octave has accomplished an immense 
        good in awakening Catholics to a mission consciousness and to the need 
        of interesting themselves in the conversion of those without the Fold.&nbsp; 
        In these days of darkness and confusion, when the enemies of Christ seem 
        to be triumphing as never before, how great is our obligation to pour 
        forth fervent prayer for the souls of the millions who wander in 
        darkness, that God in his Mercy will grant them the grace of conversion.&nbsp; 
        Let us take very seriously our responsibility with regard to the souls 
        of our brethren, and make this yearly Octave truly a week of grace!<font face="Times New Roman">

        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify">&quot;In every age it has been the concern of the Roman 
          Pontiffs, Our predecessors, and likewise it concerns Us greatly, that 
          Christians who have, unfortunately, withdrawn from the Catholic 
          Religion should at length be recalled to us as a forsaken Mother.&nbsp; 
          For in the Unity of the Faith the foremost characteristic of the truth 
          of the Church shines forth, and it is thus that the Apostle Paul 
          exhorts the Ephesians to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond 
          of peace, by proclaiming that there is <i>One Lord, one Faith, one 
          Baptism</i> (Ephes. 4:5).&nbsp; With a glad mind, therefore, We have 
          heard that prayers have been proposed to be recited from the Feast of 
          the Chair of the Blessed Peter at Rome to the Feast of the Conversion 
          of St. Paul, in order that this aim of Unity might be obtained from 
          the Lord.&nbsp; We mercifully grant and bestow in the Lord a Plenary 
          Indulgence and remission of their sins to each and all the faithful of 
          Christ who from the eighteenth day of the month of January, the 
          Festival of the Chair of Blessed Peter of Rome, until the twenty-fifth 
          day of the same month, on which the Conversion of St. Paul is 
          commemorated, shall recite once a day the prayers appointed.&quot;&nbsp;
