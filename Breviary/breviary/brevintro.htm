    <p align="left"><b><font size="4" color="#336633">I. THE ORIGIN OF 
    THE BREVIARY</font></b> </p>
    <p align="justify">THE LITURGY, or official public worship of the Church, 
    comprises the holy sacrifice of the Mass, the Sacraments and Sacramentals, 
    and the canonical hours, or official daily prayer of the Church. It is the 
    latter which is contained in the Roman Breviary, par excellence, the 
    prayer-book of the Church. There are prayers outside the Breviary, approved 
    by the Church, enriched by her with indulgences, beloved as private 
    devotions, but the Divine Office, contained in the Breviary, is the great 
    official prayer recited daily by the Church as the mystical body of Christ, 
    divine Head and human members together, to pay worship to God only second in 
    importance to that supreme act of religious cult, the sacrifice of the Mass.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">The word breviary, etymologically a compendium or 
    abridgment, is applied to the liturgical work which contains the psalms and 
    the hymns, the readings from Sacred Scripture and from the writings of the 
    Fathers, the prayers and the responses, which are combined to form the 
    canonical hours of the divine office of prayer recited daily throughout the 
    world by priests and religious. Originally, several books were required for 
    the celebration of Mass: the Sacramentary for the officiating priest, the 
    Lectionary for the principal assisting ministers, and the Antiphonary for 
    the choir. When these were assembled in one book, the volume was called a 
    complete Mass-book (Missale plenum), our present Missal. So, also, when the 
    various volumes anciently used in the recitation of the canonical hours: the 
    psalter, other books of the Bible, selected writings of the Fathers, 
    collections of prayers and hymns, were gathered together into one work, the 
    volume came to be called a Breviary. </p>
    <p align="justify">The origin of the canonical hours of the Divine Office, 
    as they are recited daily in the Church, either publicly by chapters of 
    canons or monks or privately by priests and clerics in major orders, dates 
    back to the days of the primitive Church. Anciently, a vigil, or all-night 
    watch service, preceded every Sunday. This consisted of evening, night, and 
    early morning prayers and was bound up with the idea that Christ at His 
    second coming might arrive on such an eve and the faithful were desirous of 
    being found watching and praying to receive Him. By the fourth century this 
    Sunday vigil had become a daily observance, though it no longer lasted 
    throughout the night. Again, some of the faithful, and especially monks of 
    the Benedictine observance, began to meet for pious exercises at each of the 
    hours which divided the day into its principal sections, at the third, 
    sixth, and ninth hours. Later, the remaining two canonical hours Prime and 
    Compline, were introduced from monastic sources. So, we have a divine office 
    of three groups of prayers: (1) the nocturnal group, represented today by 
    the hours known as Vespers, Matins, and Lauds; (2) the day hours, now called 
    Terce, Sext, and None; (3) a form of morning prayer called Prime and of 
    evening prayer known as Compline. </p>
    <p align="justify">What had at first been an all-night vigil became a watch 
    service only from cock crow to sunrise with a preliminary office at the 
    lighting of the lamps the night before. This last survives as Vespers of the 
    Office, the early morning service being now represented by Matins, with its 
    three nocturns, and Lauds. The public prayers at the third, sixth, and ninth 
    hours, added, as has just been said, the Offices of Terce, Sext, and None. 
    Morning prayer, Prime, was inserted between Lauds and Terce; and evening 
    prayer, since Vespers did not come at the very end of the day, at bedtime, 
    furnished the concluding hour of Compline. So, from sunset to sunset, as the 
    extent of the day was reckoned by the Romans and the Jews, from evening to 
    evening, seven times were there hours of prayer: Vespers, Compline, Matins 
    and Lauds |despite their length counted as one hour), Prime, Terce, Sext, 
    and None. This was in accordance with the verse of Psalm 118: &quot;Seven times a 
    day I gave praise to Thee.&quot; The component elements of this sevenfold daily 
    service of prayer were, and still are, the psalms of the Psalter of David, 
    readings of passages from the Holy Scriptures and the works of the Fathers 
    of the Church, prayers recited by the presiding cleric, and metrical 
    compositions, or hymns. </p>
    <p align="justify">The daily recitation, or chanting, of the canonical hours 
    began as a public service in the church or in the monastery chapel. In the 
    beginning the psalms were sung by a solo voice, or several voices, the 
    congregation making occasional answers in the form of a familiar response. 
    Later, the entire body took part in the chanting, the participants being 
    arranged in two choirs, alternately chanting the verses of the psalms. 
    Readers ascended the pulpit for the lessons, to which the others listened, 
    or perhaps answered with verses, which became the present responses of the 
    office. The presiding priest, or abbot, had his own special part in the 
    prayers, represented today by the blessings and orations and versicles 
    reserved to the offíciant. The hymns of the Office are metrical compositions 
    of later introduction than the psalms and readings, and were sung by 
    specially competent chanters or alternately, stanza after stanza, by the two 
    choirs of the general body. So the Office is recited today by chapters of 
    canons in cathedral and collegiate churches and by companies of monks or 
    nuns in monasteries and convents, where there is the obligation of the 
    Divine Office. In late medieval times, especially consequent upon the spread 
    of the Franciscan Order, it became the custom for individuals who were 
    unable to attend the public assemblies in the church to recite the canonical 
    hours privately. To make provision for such individuals as well as to 
    provide the necessary text for the Divine Office in poorer religious houses 
    and in country churches, compilations of the various books involved began to 
    be made so that a single volume would suffice for the recitation of the 
    entire office. This compendious handbook became known as the Breviary and it 
    came into general use from the XII Century, though examples of such 
    compendia date from the preceding century. When, by order of the Council of 
    Trent, standard editions of the liturgical books, required in public worship 
    were issued and made of universal obligation, the official Roman Breviary 
    was that of Pope St. Pius V, published in 1568. This has remained the 
    exemplar for all editions of the Breviary since that time, though there have 
    been several revisions of the book. The last revision was that of Pius X, in 
    1911, and this is the Breviary in use today.</p>
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/dominic.jpg" webstripperlinkwas="../images/dominic.jpg" width="281" height="445"></p>
    <p align="justify"><b><font color="#336633" size="4">II DIVISIONS OF THE 
    BREVIARY</font></b> </p>
    <p align="justify">Though occasionally the Roman Breviary is issued in a 
    single volume, called a &quot;Totum,&quot; it usually appears in four volumes each 
    containing the Offices of about one-quarter of the ecclesiastical year. 
    These four are: </p>
    <p align="justify">1) The winter volume (pars hiemalis) comprising the 
    Offices of Advent, Christmastide, and Epiphany, up to and including the 
    Saturday before the First Sunday of Lent. In the calendar of the fixed 
    feasts, this part extends from November 26 to March 12. </p>
    <p align="justify">2) The spring volume (pars verna) containing the Offices 
    of Lent and Paschaltide to the Saturday of the Pentecost Ember Week, 
    inclusive. In the fixed calendar, this period begins with February 7 and 
    lasts to June 19. </p>
    <p align="justify">3) The summer volume (pars æstiva) with the time after 
    Pentecost up to the Fifteenth Sunday, inclusive. For the fixed feasts, this 
    section runs from May 18 to September 2. </p>
    <p align="justify">4) The autumn volume (pars autumnalis) covering the year 
    from the Eleventh Sunday after Pentecost till the day before Advent, August 
    28 to December 2 of the fixed calendar. </p>
    <p align="justify">It will be noted that this division of the Breviary into 
    four books is made on the basis of the temporal cycle of the ecclesiastical 
    year, that which varies from year to year, largely because of the five-week 
    variation of the date of Easter. This arrangement necessitates, in 
    succeeding volumes, a certain repetition of the Offices of feasts which are 
    fixed to the days of the month of the civil calendar. The third and fourth 
    volumes involve also a repetition of some of the Sundays after Pentecost, as 
    the regulations governing the readings from Sacred Scripture are dependent 
    upon the weeks of August September, October, and November rather than on the 
    succession of the Sundays after Pentecost. </p>
    <p align="justify">The considerable prefatory matter usually found in the 
    winter volume, is issued as a separate brochure. This introductory portion 
    contains the rules for the computation of Easter and the general directions 
    for the ordering of the Office, under the caption: &quot;General Rubrics of the 
    Breviary.&quot; This latter section is the one quaintly entitled &quot;The Pye&quot; in the 
    Marquess of Bute's famous English translation of the Breviary, which 
    appeared in 1879. These directions should be carefully studied by all who 
    would learn well the intricate structure of the Office. </p>
    <p align="justify">Each of the four volumes is arranged in accordance with 
    the following pattern: </p>
    <p align="justify">1) An introductory section, containing the calendar with 
    the fixed feasts, hosted for the months of the year, and certain convenient 
    tables for finding the movable feasts. </p>
    <p align="justify">2) The Ordinary of the Office, comprising those prayers 
    and directions which are common to all Offices. </p>
    <p align="justify">3) The Psalter, with its one hundred and fifty psalms, 
    distributed over the various canonical hours for the seven days of the week. 
    For reasons of utility, much of the preceding section is here repeated and 
    combined with the divisions of the Psalter. </p>
    <p align="justify">4) The Proper of Time, in which are found the variable 
    portions of the Office arranged in the sequence of those days which depend 
    upon the movable cycle of Easter and the less movable time of Advent. </p>
    <p align="justify">5) The Proper of the Saints, which comprises the variable 
    parts of the Office peculiar to the Feasts of the Saints, which are all 
    fixed to the days of the month of the civil calendar. </p>
    <p align="justify">6) The Common of the Saints, embracing those portions of 
    the Office which are not special for the feasts of individual Saints. </p>
    <p align="justify">7) Various appendices with the Little Office of the 
    Blessed Virgin the Office for the Dead, the Seven Penitential Psalms, the 
    Litany of the Saints, etc. </p>
    <p align="justify">For a detailed description of the seven hours of the 
    Divine Office, the introductory section of the winter volume, entitled 
    &quot;General Rubrics of the Breviary,&quot; should be studied. Many complications are 
    incident to the recitation of the Office and they are for the most part the 
    result of the constant conflict between the calendar of movable feasts (The 
    Proper of the Time) and the calendar of the fixed feasts (The Proper of the 
    Saints.) As Easter may come as early as March 22 or as late as April 25, it 
    will be seen that constant adjustments must be made each year between fixed 
    and movable feasts. For this reason, a book of directions, called the &quot;Ordo,&quot; 
    is published every year containing minute guidance for reciting the Office 
    during the course of that year.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;Originally, the Divine Office was much simpler in 
    structure than it is today and the comparatively small number of Saints' 
    days reduced to a minimum the conflict between fixed and movable feasts. 
    There was a succession of psalms followed by readings from Scripture, these 
    latter being supplemented by accounts of the martyrdom of Saints and 
    passages from the writings of the Fathers. As time went on, these 
    fundamental elements of the Office were divided by prayers and responses and 
    hymns, which were varied for day and season, until the recitation of the 
    Canonical Hours became so complicated that a process of simplification was 
    introduced in the XIII Century. A more sweeping reform was proposed under 
    Benedict XIV (1741-1747) but it was not carried out until the pontificate of 
    Pius X (1903-1914) and then only to a limited extent. The Breviary of Pius X 
    is the standard text at present, though the book is constantly receiving 
    additions as Offices are assigned to the feasts of newly canonized saints.</p>
    <p align="justify"><b><font color="#336633" size="4">&nbsp;III. COMPONENT 
    ELEMENTS OF THE BREVIARY</font></b> </p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#336633"><b>The Psalms</b></font>. The basis 
    of the Divine Office is the Psalter of David, whose one hundred and fifty 
    psalms are ordinarily recited every week. The antiphons, responses, and 
    versicles in the various hours are also very largely taken from the Psalter, 
    so this book of the Bible furnishes the greatest percentage of the text of 
    the Office. The psalms give poetic expression to the entire gamut of 
    religious thought and emotion from sobs of contrition to songs of 
    confidence, from elegies of dejection to paens of delight. No cry of sorrow 
    could be deeper than the &quot;Miserere,&quot; (Ps. 50). No petition for mercy could 
    be more poignant than the &quot;De profundis,&quot; (Ps. 129). No hymn of joy could be 
    more exultant than the last three psalms of the Psalter (Pss. 148, 149, 
    150.) In the interests of clearer understanding of the text the psalms in 
    this edition of the Breviary are presented in an English translation of the 
    new Latin version of the Psalter, authorized by Pope Pius XII. </p>
    <p align="justify">Similar in structure to the psalms are certain
    <font color="#336633"><b>canticles</b></font> of the Old Testament, which 
    are assigned to Lauds of the Office, and three canticles from the Gospels, 
    the &quot;Magnificat,&quot; the &quot;Benedictus,&quot; and the &quot;Nunc dimittis,&quot; which are 
    recited every day, respectively, in the hours of Vespers, Lauds, and 
    Compline. </p>
    <p align="justify"><b><font color="#336633">The Readings, or Lessons</font></b>.&nbsp; 
    Second only to the psalms in the textual content of the Breviary come the 
    readings from Sacred Scripture and from the writings of the Fathers of the 
    Church. The Scriptural readings are selected so that all the books of the 
    Bible are represented in the lessons of the first nocturn of Matins, and in 
    the course of the year both Old and New Testaments are covered at least in 
    summary fashion. The Gospels are read only in short excerpts in the third 
    nocturn, serving as introductions to the homilies, or commentaries on the 
    Gospels, taken from the writings of the Fathers of the Church. Lives of the 
    Saints are assigned as lessons for the second nocturn on their feast days. 
    The longer readings, which are those just described, are known as lessons 
    and appear only in Matins of the Office. For the other hours, shorter 
    passages, usually from Sacred Scripture, are assigned and these are called 
    Little Chapters (Capitula.)</p>
    <p align="justify"><b><font color="#336633">Prayers</font></b>.&nbsp; The 
    prayer, or oration, proper for each day of the Office, is the collect of the 
    Mass of that day and is said near the close of five of the seven Hours. 
    Prime and Compline have special orations of their own, which are invariable 
    day after day. For information concerning the prayers said as 
    Commemorations, reference should be had to the explanations in the &quot;General 
    Rubrics of the Breviary&quot; Among the prayers of the Office should be included 
    certain petitions and responses (Preces) which are recited especially on 
    days of fasting and penance. Our more familiar forms of vocal prayer, the 
    &quot;Our Father,&quot; the &quot;Hail Mary,&quot; and (less frequently) the Apostles' Creed, 
    are repeatedly recited in the Office.</p>
    <p align="justify"><b><font color="#336633">Hymns</font></b>.&nbsp; The 
    original hymnbook of the Church was the Psalter, and the earliest hymns were 
    compositions in imitation of the structure of the psalms. Later, more 
    definitely metrical stanzas were written and these are the hymns which 
    appear in every hour of the Divine Office. Some of these are identical day 
    by day, but most of them vary with the season or the feast. </p>
    <p align="justify">To the elements just enumerated as component parts of the 
    Breviary should be added: the &quot;Te Deum,&quot; which concludes Matins on feast 
    days; the Athanasian Creed (Quicumque), which is recited at Prime on 
    ordinary Sundays; and the anthems of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which are 
    varied for the seasons of the year as terminating prayers of the Office. Two 
    of these anthems, are the familiar &quot;Regina cæli,&quot; the Angelus of the Easter 
    time, and the even more familiar &quot;Hail, holy Queen.&quot;</p>
    <p align="justify">The basic structure of the Breviary shows that the Divine 
    Office was meant to be a public choral service. Certain parts were to be 
    recited, or chanted, alternately by two sections (choirs) of those 
    participating. Other portions were to be read by a solo offíciant, and still 
    others were designed as answers to be said in concert by the entire body to 
    prayers or readings of a leader. When it became the custom for those unable 
    to join in the public recitation to say the Office privately, the present 
    more common practice arose whereby the individual must recite the entire 
    Office himself, instead of dividing his participation by reading some parts 
    and listening while fellow participants recite other parts.</p>
    <p align="justify"><b><font color="#336633" size="4">IV. THE EXCELLENCE OF 
    THE BREVIARY</font></b> The chief claim for the pre-eminence of the 
    Canonical Hours over all other forms of prayer is that the Breviary contains 
    the official, liturgical prayer of the Church. Whether the Office be recited 
    publicly in choir or privately by an individual, it is not a private prayer, 
    but the daily service of public praise, rendered to God, as prescribed by 
    the Church. Those who recite the Divine Office do so in the name of all the 
    faithful and for the benefit of all the members of the mystical body of 
    Christ. The laity have had little opportunity to make the acquaintance of 
    the treasury of prayer represented by the Breviary. Formerly, Vespers, often 
    unfortunately in a rather truncated version, used to be a regular Sunday 
    service in parish churches, but this practice has become almost obsolete. In 
    some places, the faithful have become somewhat familiar with Matins and 
    Lauds of the last three days of Holy Week, the &quot;Tenebræ&quot; Office in most 
    cathedrals and in some other important churches. This present English 
    translation of the Divine Office will make available to the laity, not well 
    conversant with Latin, the opportunity to participate, day by day, in the 
    liturgical prayer of the Church. Nor will this version, it is hoped, be 
    without use to the clergy and others who are bound to the recitation of the 
    Breviary. The English text should prove convenient for comparison with the 
    Latin original to throw light on passages of difficult interpretation.</p>
    <p align="justify">The words which are pronounced in the recitation of the 
    Divine Office are chiefly from the inspired writings of the Bible. Most of 
    the prayers are venerable compositions, centuries old. The Readings from the 
    works of the Fathers express the traditional thought of the Church. The 
    hymns are examples of lofty, spiritual poetry. NO other prayer is endowed 
    with such special grace. No other can equal its rank as the authorized, 
    official prayer of the Universal Church. Moreover, through the consistent 
    use of the Missal and the Breviary we are enabled to live again the 
    mysteries of Christ as they are presented to us in the seasons of the 
    ecclesiastical year. Mass and Divine Office are liturgically interrelated. 
    The latter furnishes the setting for the Mass, as the gold of the ring is 
    the setting for the precious jewel of its stone. When the Office is chanted 
    in common the Mass of the day is inserted during the course of the Canonical 
    hours, usually after Terce.&nbsp; The daily Mass and the daily Office form the 
    liturgical mirror which reflects, day after day, year after year, the 
    mysteries of the life of Jesus Christ as the Church unfolds them, feast by 
    feast and season by season. All the interior formation of man is effected by 
    the better knowledge of Our Lord, His life and His works and His words The 
    daily thoughtful reading of the Breviary cannot fail to bring one into 
    better acquaintance with &quot;The mystery which hath been hidden from ages and 
    generations but is now manifested to his Saints&quot; (Col. 1, 26). In the Divine 
    Office, we sing to God a twelve-month hymn of praise in lasting memory of 
    the life of Christ on earth and constant recognition of His life in heaven 
    as we commemorate His life and His death, His resurrection and ascension, 
    His life in glory in heaven and His eucharistic continuance in life on 
    earth.</p>
    <p align="justify">Associated with the annual cycle of the liturgical 
    commemoration of the mysteries of Jesus Christ is the yearly cycle of the 
    feasts of His Saints. In the celebration of the Saint's days, we worship God 
    indirectly as &quot;wonderful in His Saints&quot; and we seek the intercession of 
    those whose lives were models for our imitation in their devoted service of 
    God, &quot;the crown of all Saints.&quot; The recitation of the Divine Office, both as 
    the direct cult of God and the indirect worship of Him paid through the 
    honor shown His Saints will, in the words of the present Holy Father's great 
    encyclical letter, &quot;Mediator Dei,&quot; give us a part in that sacred liturgy on 
    earth which is a preparation for the heavenly liturgy, in which along with 
    Mary, the glorious Mother of God, and all the Saints, we confidently hope to 
    sing eternally &quot;to Him who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb, blessing 
    and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and strength forever and 
    ever&quot; (Apoc. V, 13). </p>
