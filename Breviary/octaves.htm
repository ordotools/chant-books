<title>Rules for Octaves</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following rules govern the commemorations of octaves in Vespers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the current day and the following day are both of the octave, the 
commemoration is from Second Vespers of the octave.</p>
<p>If neither the current day nor the following day are of the octave, the 
commemoration is from Second Vespers of the octave.</p>
<p>If the current day is of the octave but the following day is not, the 
commemoration is from Second Vespers.</p>
<p>If the current day is not of the octave, but the following day is, the 
commemoration is from First Vespers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>An octave is commemorated in Vespers using the antiphon from Second 
Vespers in all cases except when the following day is of the octave day, or the current day is not of the octave and the 
following day is, even if the octave day is overridden by another feast.</b></p>
